# flights_delay_analysis
This is the analysis of flight delay data available in public. I have structured the notebook to answers the questions below:
Exploration of the flight data to analyze possible factors that affect delays in departure or arrival of a flight.

1. Start by cleaning the data.
	- Identify any null or missing data, and impute appropriate replacement values.
	- Identify and eliminate any outliers in the DepDelay and ArrDelay columns.
2. Explore the cleaned data.
	- View summary statistics for the numeric fields in the dataset.
	- Determine the distribution of the DepDelay and ArrDelay columns.
	- Use statistics, aggregate functions, and visualizations to answer the following questions:
	- What are the average (mean) departure and arrival delays?
	- How do the carriers compare in terms of arrival delay performance?
	- Is there a noticable difference in arrival delays for different days of the week?
	- Which departure airport has the highest average departure delay?
	- Do late departures tend to result in longer arrival delays than on-time departures?
	- Which route (from origin airport to destination airport) has the most late arrivals?
	- Which route has the highest average arrival delay?
